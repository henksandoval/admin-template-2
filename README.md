## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
# Development build (recommended)
npx ng build --configuration=development

# Production build (may fail in restricted environments due to Google Fonts)
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Testing

Unit tests are configured with Karma + Jasmine but no test files exist yet:

```bash
ng test  # Will show "No inputs were found in config file"
```

## Architecture

The project follows a **Hybrid Architecture** pattern:

- **`src/app/core/`** - Singleton services (AuthService, guards, interceptors)
- **`src/app/features/`** - Business feature modules (lazy-loaded)
- **`src/app/layout/`** - App shell components (Header, Sidebar, Footer)  
- **`src/app/shared/`** - Reusable components following Atomic Design
- **`src/themes/`** - SCSS theme files and Material Design setup

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter installation issues:

1. **Clear everything**: `npm run clean && npm run fresh-install`
2. **Check Node.js version**: `node --version` (should be v20+)
3. **See detailed guide**: [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)
